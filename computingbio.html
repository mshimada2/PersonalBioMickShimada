<h1>Mick Shimadas Computing Biography</h1>

<p> In the past I have taken various computer classes. This included scripting for video games which I did not do too well in, and in high school I also took a class called IT Essentials.
   Currently, I am enrolled in CSCI 101, and CINS 110 at Chico State and I enjoy both because I have great teachers and I am learning a lot. 
  I will continue to get better at programming and by the end of this semester I hope I am at the point where I can code off the top of my head rather than referring back to my notes to help me.</p>
