<h2>Individual Repositories</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This was my very first project. It was the first time I was introduced to coding in HTML and finding out who Marvin Minsky was.
     <a href="https://github.com/mshimada2/MarvinMinsky">Marvin Minsky Repository</a> </li>
    <li>In this project, there were a few things wrong within the HTML code. We were instructed to pick out what was wrong and fix it.
      <a href="https://github.com/mshimada2/ChicoInShort"> Chico In Short</a> </li>
    <li>For the Professor Page, this was the first time we were introduced to CSS to be able to style our HTML code.
      <a href="https://github.com/mshimada2/MarvinMinsky">Professor Page</a> </li>
    <li>In Movie Spoiler, we gave a summary of our favorite movie but we hid any spoilers by blakcing out the text.
      However if users wanted to see the spoiler, they could hoverover the text and it would be revealed.

    <li>In Building Tabs, we made different tabs that could get us to different webpages by clicking on the links. <a href="https://github.com/mshimada2/BuildingTabs">Building Tabs</a> </li>
    <li>Last but not least, in My Schedule, we made a table with Buffardis class schedule. We gave the table a different background color, a hover, and aligned the text.
